## Functions created to get the inverse of a matrix using caching

## This function creates a special "matrix" as a list containing a
## function to set/get values of the matrix and set/get values of
## the inverse of the matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  

}


## This function calculates the inverse of the special "matrix"
## created with the makeCacheMatrix function.
## If the inverse has already gotten (and no matrix changes), then
## this function returns the inverse from the cache

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
